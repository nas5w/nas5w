### 👋 Thanks for dropping by!

I'm a front-end software engineer about to start with [COMING SOON]. Previously, I worked on modernizing government software systems with the [U.S. Digital Service](https://usds.gov)! In my spare time (very little these days!) I write blog posts and make videos about front-end tech.
