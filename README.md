### About

I'm a senior UI engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I worked on modernizing government software systems with the [U.S. Digital Service](https://usds.gov). In my spare time, you'll find me writing blog posts, newsletters, and contributing to open source.

### How the Web Works

How the Web Works is a course I'm working on about, well, how the web works! The goal is to explain important web concepts in simple terms. I'm currently developing the course over on Substack, [where you can subscribe for free (or become a paid supporter if you'd like)](https://howthewebworks.substack.com/). Ultimately, I hope to publish this as a standalone course when I'm finished.
