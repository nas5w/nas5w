### About

I'm a senior UI engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I worked on modernizing government software systems with the [U.S. Digital Service](https://usds.gov)! In my spare time (very little these days!) I write blog posts and make videos about front-end tech.

### Stuff I work on

I like working on lots of projects in my spare time! There's a good chance one of them brought you to my profile here. If you're interested in following some of my work, consider:
