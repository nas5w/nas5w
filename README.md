### About

I'm a senior UI engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I worked on modernizing government software systems with the [U.S. Digital Service](https://usds.gov). In my spare time, you'll find me writing blog posts, newsletters, and contributing to open source.

### Currently hacking on

**Govsky!**

I have recently been getting into the Bluesky ecosystem. I think their domain-based handle system is really neat and is especially useful in verifying and cataloging regulated domain extensions (like .gov). Govsky is an effort to index all government accounts on Bluesky and implement various bots/lists/feeds to make them known to the public. There is additionally a web app to facilitate searching.
